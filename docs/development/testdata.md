    This page is primarily targeted at developers. If you are a normal user of
    this plugin, you can safely skip this section.

For testing purposes, a Moodle course that contains a reference quiz is provided.

The quiz features an instance of every standard question type that is part of
the Moodle core. Example students are enrolled and graded quiz attempts have
been made, ready to test the archive functionality.

The reference course moreover contains further quizzes with different numbers of
attempts to test the throughput of the quiz archive worker service.


## Importing the Reference Course

You can import the reference course from the corresponding Moodle backup file
