# Configuration

This sections describes the required steps to initially set up the plugin.

In summary: A dedicated Moodle user, a global role to manage permissions, and a
webservice for the archive worker must be created and the Moodle plugin must be
configured accordingly. Luckily, this can be done automatically using a single
button (see [Automatic Configuration](/configuration/initialconfig/automatic)).

If you encounter any issues during the configuration process, please open a bug
report or ask a question in the issue tracker over on GitHub.

## Starting the Configuration

!!! warning "Prerequisites"
    Before you start the initial configuration, make sure you have the following
    components successfully installed:

    - [Moodle Plugin](/installation/moodleplugin)
    - [Archive Worker Service](/installation/archiveworker) (or using the
      [free public demo service](/installation/archiveworker#using-the-free-public-demo-service))

After installation, you need to perform an [initial configuration step](/configuration/initialconfig/automatic) once.
