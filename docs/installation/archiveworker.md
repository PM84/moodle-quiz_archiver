# Quiz Archive Worker Service

This section describes the installation of the quiz archive worker service,
that works in conjunction with the [quiz_archiver](https://github.com/ngandrass/moodle-quiz_archiver)
Moodle plugin. It can be installed using multiple ways, though using
[Docker Compose](#installation-using-docker-compose) is recommended.

The quiz archive worker service processes quiz archive jobs in the background.
It renders Moodle quiz attempts into PDF files, collects Moodle backups,
generates checksums, and packs the final quiz archives before it uploads it back
the Moodle instance.

## Installation using Docker Compose

!!! success "Info"
    This is the suggested way of installing the quiz archive worker service :thumbsup:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` inside a `moodle-quiz-archive-worker` folder
   with the following content:
   ```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
   services:
     moodle-quiz-archive-worker:
       image: ngandrass/moodle-quiz-archive-worker:latest
       container_name: moodle-quiz-archive-worker
       restart: always
       ports:
         - "8080:8080/tcp"
       environment:
         - QUIZ_ARCHIVER_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   ```
3. From inside the `moodle-quiz-archive-worker` folder, run the application:
   ```text
   docker compose up
   ```

!!! info "Changing the service port"
    You can change the port that the quiz archive worker service is exposed on
    the Docker host by replacing the first port number in the `ports` argument
    within the `docker-compose.yml` file.

    ```yaml title="Example: Expose the service on port 4242"
    ports:
      - "4242:8080/tcp"
    ```

!!! info "Changing configuration values"
    You can change all [configuration values](#configuration) by setting the
    respective environment variables inside `docker-compose.yml`. For more
    details and all available configuration parameters see [Configuration](#configuration).

    ```yaml title="Example: Set the log level to DEBUG"
    environment:
      - QUIZ_ARCHIVER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
    ```

### Running the application in the background

To run the application in the background, append the `-d` argument to your
command:

```text
docker compose up -d
```

### Removing the application

To remove all created containers, networks and volumes, run the following
command from inside the `moodle-quiz-archive-worker` folder:

```text
docker compose down
```

## Installation using Docker

!!! info
    This is an alternative way of installing the quiz archive worker service
    using Docker directly.

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. Run a new container:
  ```text
  docker run -p 8080:8080 ngandrass/moodle-quiz-archive-worker:latest
  ```

!!! info "Changing the service port"
    You can change the host port the application is bound to by changing the
    first port number in the `-p` argument of the `docker run` command.

    ```text title="Example: Expose the service on port 4242"
    docker run -p 4242:8080 moodle-quiz-archive-worker:latest
    ```

!!! info "Changing configuration values"
    You can change all [configuration values](#configuration) by setting the
    respective environment variables. For more details and all available
    configuration parameters see [Configuration](#configuration).

    ```text title="Example: Set the log level to DEBUG"
    docker run -e QUIZ_ARCHIVER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG -p 8080:8080 moodle-quiz-archive-worker:latest
    ```


### Building the image locally

You can also build the Docker image locally by conducting the following steps:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. Clone the Git repository: `git clone https://github.com/ngandrass/moodle-quiz-archive-worker`
3. Switch into the repository directory: `cd moodle-quiz-archive-worker`
4. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t moodle-quiz-archive-worker:latest .`[^1]
5. Run a container: `docker run -p 8080:8080 moodle-quiz-archive-worker:latest`

[^1]: The `.` at the end of the `docker build` command **must** be part of the
command. It specifies the current directory as the build context. 

## Manual Installation

!!! warning
    This is the most complex way of installing the quiz archive worker service.
    Please try to use a Docker based installation if possible.

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) version >= 3.11
2. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `pip install poetry`
3. Clone the Git repository: `git clone https://github.com/ngandrass/moodle-quiz-archive-worker`
4. Switch into the repository directory: `cd moodle-quiz-archive-worker`
5. Install app dependencies: `poetry install`
6. Download [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) browser binaries: `poetry run python -m playwright install chromium`
7. Run the application: `poetry run python main.py`

!!! info "Changing configuration values"
    You can change configuration values by prepending the respective environment
    variables. For more details and all available configuration parameters see
    [Configuration](#configuration).

    ```text title="Example: Set the service port to 4242"
    QUIZ_ARCHIVER_SERVER_PORT=4242 poetry run python moodle-quiz-archive-worker.py
    ```

need to perform the initial [configuration](/configuration) once, to make the
plugin work.
